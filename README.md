# Data Science 101

As an aspiring data scientist, my pursuit extends beyond skill acquisition. I am driven to comprehend the current landscape of job opportunities in this dynamic field. To achieve this, I initiated a project focused on web scraping job postings to conduct an in-depth analysis. The primary objectives are twofold: firstly, to discern the essential criteria for securing a position in this role, and secondly, to identify the requisite skill set demanded by the industry.

This initiative begins with the extraction of job data from various postings, enabling a profound exploration of my own skillset while gaining insights into the recruitment patterns within the data science sphere. The project aims to shed light on the evolving demands of the data scientist role and facilitate my growth in alignment with industry expectations.
